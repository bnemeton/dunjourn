        <h2>OUTLINE</h2>
        <p>
            The old outline I had here doesn't really apply anymore because I am kind of restructuring my goals here. Instead of a website and web service the goal for now is a program users run locally, where dungeon files (now simple .txt) are sent by whatever normal means of messaging or filesharing users prefer.

    <h2>OUTLINE</h2>
    <P>Here's a rough plan for what I want to implement, in three rough phases.</p>
    <p>Things within a phase may not happen in the listed order, but all things in a phase will probably need to be done before I move on to the next one.</p>
    <p>I'll also mention some less certain features I am considering that are not currently planned.</p>

    <h2> PHASE ONE:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>more or less, finish a static version of this site with one "social dungeon": mine</li>
        <li>some attempts will be made to keep in mind future plans, e.g. creature and item types will be read from an external file rather than be built-in classes of object the way they were in Flamecant, to make it easier to import them from user-provided files later</li>
        <li>basic traits for items and creatures (e.g. "consumable", "weapon", "has_hands", etc)</li>
        <li>obvi, multifloor dungeons</li>
        <li>basic environmental interaction items (keys, torches, etc)</li>
        <li>basic map tiles: floor and wall are done, but right now you can't use levelmaps that have stairs, doors, etc. shouldn't be too hard to add doors, stairs, some light source tile, maybe a water tile, etc.</li>
        <li>improve inventory system from Flamecant (which was letter hotkeys only) to allow for easier inventory management</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> PHASE TWO:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>the biggest phase, probably, this is when I will implement users/login, personal dungeons, etc</li>
        <li>obvi that means a server and database, so I'll have to remember how to set that stuff up (I can probably manage it)</li>
        <li>users, login, probably password recovery if I let people register with their emails</li>
        <li>ability to upload a json with creature and item types, texts, etc</li>
        <li>some ability to upload dungeons (json? some kind of text file? what's the simplest thing that I wouldn't have to build a level editor for?)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> PHASE THREE:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>this is when I get fancy with it</li>
        <li>in-browser level editor!</li>
        <li>text entry for passwords to secret rooms!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> PHASE ???:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>animated tiles?</li>
        <li>dim light, rendering darker glyphs and unhelpful tooltips?</li>
        <li>various floor tiles rendered with different characters?</li>
        <li>mouse controls?</li>
        <li>dungeon guestbooks or graffiti so visitors can leave messages?
            <ul>
                <li>abuse/harassment concerns</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>OUTLINE</h2>
    <P>Here's a rough plan for what I want to implement, in three rough phases.</p>
    <p>Things within a phase may not happen in the listed order, but all things in a phase will probably need to be done before I move on to the next one.</p>
    <p>I'll also mention some less certain features I am considering that are not currently planned.</p>

    <h2> PHASE ONE</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>more or less, finish a static version of this site with one "social dungeon": mine</li>
        <li>some attempts will be made to keep in mind future plans, e.g. creature and item types will be read from an external file rather than be built-in classes of object the way they were in Flamecant, to make it easier to import them from user-provided files later</li>
    </ul>

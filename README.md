# DUNJOURN 0.0.1

A gradual conversion of my unfinished roguelike project, Flamecant, into an experimental social medium where users share minimal dungeons (saved as text files) with one another.
Don't expect much yet, I'm still working on setting up the minimal static version of this concept. For an extremely loose plan or outline, see /outline.
Dunjourn uses rot.js, a set of javascript libraries for roguelike games, because that's what I've been using for Flamecant.

## Controls
- movement controls are no longer numpad only!
- new: you can use qweasdzxc like the numpad for movement! what this means is imagine the keys Q W E / A S D / Z X C are on a compass, with S at the center; each letter makes you move in its corresponding compass direction, except for S, which makes you wait for one turn in place!
- for numpad controls, it works like old school roguelikes: the compass is centered on 5. When using numpad don't forget to turn on numlock!
- to attack an enemy, move into its tile!
- p to pick up items in your tile
- i to open inventory
- menus use mouse controls!
- escape should back you out of any menus, but it's possible I missed something.
- comma descends downward staircases; period ascends upward ones
- if you mouse over a tile you can see, a tooltip will tell you what is present in that tile!

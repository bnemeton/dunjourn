    <h1>DUNJOURN 0.0.1</h1>
    <P>A gradual conversion of my unfinished roguelike project, Flamecant, into an experimental social media platform where users have dungeons instead of profiles.</P>
    <p>Don't expect much yet, I'm still working on setting up the minimal static version of this concept. For an extremely loose plan or outline, see <a href="/outline.html">/outline</a>.</p>

    <h2>-------------| CONTROLS | --------------</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>movement controls are no longer numpad only!
            <ul>
                <li>new: you can use qweasdzxc like the numpad for movement!</li>
                <li>what this means is imagine the keys Q W E / A S D / Z X C are on a compass, with S at the center;</li>
                <li>each letter makes you move in its corresponding compass direction, except for S, which makes you wait for one turn in place!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
            
        <li>for numpad controls, it works like old school roguelikes: the compass is centered on 5.</li>
        <li>to attack an enemy, move into its tile!</li>
        <li>when using numpad don't forget to turn on numlock!</li>
        <li>p to pick up items in your tile</li>
        <li>i to open inventory</li>
        <li>use the letter index next to the menu item you want to select!</li>
        <li>escape <strong>should</strong> back you out of any menus, but it's possible I missed something.</li>
        <li>cursor/selector and mouse options under consideration!</li>
        <li>on multi-select menus (like picking up multiple items from a tile):</li>
        <li> hit all the indices for desired menu items to change the "-" into a "+" and then hit enter/return to pick them up!</li>
        <li>comma descends downward staircases (">""); period ascends upward ones ("<"</li>
    </ul>
